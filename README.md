This is the code for my blog, which can be found here:
https://atfirsthand.herokuapp.com/

The site:
-  was built with Ruby on Rails 5.2.3; 
-  has a postgreSQL database
-  uses bootstrap 4.0.0.alpha3.
-  is deployed on heroku
-  I am also using an Amazon S3 repository to store photos used on the blog.

The repository is called travels as I couldn't decide what to call the blog when I started.
